# Striped Horse Resources Limited
## Website design and build in React

### Project brief
This was a design & build project for Striped Horse Resources Limited. The client provided text and images. I created logo, layout and built the site with create-react-app using Sass for styling.

The sections ('pages') of the site were given by the client.
- Home
- Services
- Partners
- About
- Ethics
- Contact

### Responsiveness
The site is responsive to different screen resolutions and orientations. Several breakpoints are defined as Sass variables and these assign different styling sizes and layouts accordingly.
